# Dama
A neural-network-evaluated chess engine based off of the extraordinary work of Giraffe.

This library is currently **in development.**
Future plans include using FiLM (Feature-Wise Linear Modulations), a type of feature-wise transformation to improve results. Currently, the neural networks presented in tne `inprogress` folder have not yet been trained or tested. Development is expected to finish in the following months (Before 1/1/2021).
